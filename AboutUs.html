<p style="text-align:center;">Holy Spirit National High School was created because of the need to provide quality and accessible education to students of Barangay Holy Spirit. To deal with the increasing number of enrollees at Commonwealth High School, the local government has come up with the proposal of putting up an annex in the said barangay.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Under the leadership of Quezon City Mayor Feliciano “Sonny” Belmonte, Jr., with the support of Mr. Cresencio M. Viernes, Principal of Commonwealth High School, Mr. Felicito A. Valmocina, Barangay Captain and the residents of Barangay Holy Spirit, together they sought the assistance of the Department of Public Works and Highways Secretary Simeon Datumanong to find a suitable abode for the establishment of the school. With the approval and assistance of Secretary Datumanong, the Quezon City government was able to acquire one thousand five hundred square meters (1,500 sq. m.) of land from the thirty thousand square meters (30,000 sq. m.) property of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). It is the present site of Holy Spirit National High School.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;">The school first operated on July 4, 2003 as Commonwealth High School – Holy Spirit Annex and was officially inaugurated on September 26, 2003. The first batch, consisting of 1,003 first year and second year students, came from Commonwealth High School. Nine (9) permanent, seven (7) auxiliaries and three (3) substitute teachers volunteered and eventually became the pioneer mentors of the school. Mr. Cresencio M. Viernes, school principal and Dr. Modesto G. Villarin,  Head Teacher – in – Charge were appointed to supervise the newly founded establishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Dr. Villarin created a program to uplift the quality of learning of the school. His strict but humane management helped the school in instilling discipline to the students. With the promotion of Dr. Villarin, (July 2004) as principal of Tandang Sora National High School, Miss Juanita C. Alajar was appointed as Officer – In – Charge.

Ms. Alajar was the former Head Teacher of Juan Sumulong High School who emphasized the need for quality education through mastery of the language. Her love for nature led to the establishment of the “Halamanan at Gulayan sa Paaralan”, a program recognized by the community as a manageable and cost effective way of planning edible flora in the school.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;"> In September 2005, Miss Alajar was eventually promoted to Payatas High School. Dr. Eladio H. Escolano was appointed Officer – In – Charge. He was the former Head Teacher of the Technology and Livelihood Education in Carlos P. Garcia High School.  Dr. Escolano initiated the first Friday Holy Mass inside the school campus. It was during Dr. Escolano’s term where ASTP for Administration, ASTP for Supervision and ASTP for Special Projects were created.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> In June 2006, after a year of Dr. Escolano’s leadership in the school,  Dr. Launcelot T. Lauigan, a Master Teacher from Ramon Magsaysay Cubao High School took over the position. Dr. Lauigan made the shortest term in Holy Spirit 
National High School for he was eventually promoted as principal of  Don Quitin Paredes High School after six (6) months.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;">In December 2006, Mrs. Zaida M. Padullo succeeded Dr. Lauigan as Officer – In – Charge. Active and young, the former Administrative Officer of Commonwealth High School started to implement rules that suited the needs of the students. She prioritized and gave importance to the independency of the school. On July 2007, through her efforts, Commonwealth High School – Holy Spirit Annex became an independent school and was renamed Holy Spirit National High School. She reactivated the “Halaman at Gulay sa Paaralan” project and restricted the school’s organizational setup. On her first year, she reclassified five (5) Teacher I positions to Master Teacher I and converted six (6) teacher items into Head Teachers on her second year.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">At present, Holy Spirit National High School has come a long way, from its initial budget of    Ᵽ200,000.00 (two hundred thousand pesos), Mrs. Padullo utilized for bigger allocation. From Ᵽ200,000.00 in 2006 to Ᵽ1.2M in 2007, Ᵽ1.7M in 2008 and Ᵽ2.5M in 2009. It was also during her term that 60 new positions were created in addition to the existing 25 permanent positions rounding off the total number of permanent teachers to 85. This allocation enabled her to make significant improvement in the physical facilities of the school like the creation of Science Laboratory, Clinic, Practice House, and provided teachers with materials needed to improve their instruction.</p>
